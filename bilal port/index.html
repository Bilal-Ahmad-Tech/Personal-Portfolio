         <p>I am a dedicated Python programmer and front-end web developer with a robust foundation in computer science, backed by a one-year Diploma in Information Technology (DIT) from Islamia College Peshawar. My journey has been marked by resilience, perseverance, and a deep commitment to continuous learning. I have hands-on experience in Python, where I apply my skills to solve complex problems and develop innovative projects, including a calculator and a car game, both of which demonstrate my grasp of programming fundamentals and logical thinking. Additionally, my front-end projects, such as a car rental platform, a vegetable store, and a coffee shop website, highlight my ability to create responsive, user-centric designs. My goal is to further refine my skills, stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech industry, and contribute meaningfully to the field by leveraging both Python and web development expertise.</p>
